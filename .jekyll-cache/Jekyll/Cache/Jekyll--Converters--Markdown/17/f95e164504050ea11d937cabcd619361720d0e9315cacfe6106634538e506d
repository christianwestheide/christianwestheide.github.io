<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the <a href="https://finance.univie.ac.at/en/" target="_blank">University of Vienna</a>. I have previously been with the University of Mannheim and the <a href="https://safe-frankfurt.de" target="_blank">Research Center SAFE</a> (Goethe University Frankfurt). My research interests mainly lie in empirical financial market microstructure. More generally, I am interested in the interaction of market participants that differ in terms of information, ability, and objectives, and in how these interactions affect asset prices and liquidity. Thus, the scope of my research also extends to topics such as insider trading.</p>
